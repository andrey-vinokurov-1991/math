    "Each *connection* is some transformation (some function) from a number to a number. The layers of the network are numerated from left to right and by state of the neurons of the previous layer. Using these connection we calculate the state of the neurons of the previous layer. In the result, each neuron has some state (a number). The state of the neurons of the last layer is the output of the neural network."
